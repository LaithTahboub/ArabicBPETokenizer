This is part of a research project supervised by Dr. Nayeem to train an LLM on Islamic knowledge. This LLM will be trained primarily or solely on authentic Arabic texts. Before we can perform this training, we need a strong Arabic tokenizer that effectively produces a vocabulary that can be used later during training and inference.
